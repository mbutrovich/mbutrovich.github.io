I am a distributed database engineer at [Apple](https://www.apple.com) working on the Data Platform team. Currently, I am enhancing [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org)'s performance by contributing to [Apache DataFusion Comet](https://datafusion.apache.org/comet/), a native query execution engine built on [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) and [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org).

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu), where I researched database management systems (DBMSs) with [Andy Pavlo](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/) and the rest of the [CMU Database Group](https://db.cs.cmu.edu). My research explored operating system and DBMS co-design opportunities via safe kernel extension mechanisms like [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf/).

I previously completed an M.Sc. in Computer Science at CMU, graduating in December 2018. Before graduate school, I worked at [Western Digital](https://www.westerndigital.com) for over eight years, performing firmware validation on storage devices while earning a B.Sc. in Computer Science & Engineering at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu) and [Irvine Valley College](https://www.ivc.edu).
