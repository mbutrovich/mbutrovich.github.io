I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu), where I researched database management systems (DBMSs). I explored operating system and DBMS codesign opportunities via safe kernel extension mechanisms like [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf/).

I previously completed an M.Sc. in Computer Science at CMU, graduating in December 2018. Before graduate school, I worked at [Western Digital](https://www.westerndigital.com) for over eight years, performing firmware validation on storage devices while earning a B.Sc. in Computer Science & Engineering at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu) and [Irvine Valley College](https://www.ivc.edu).
